Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. "

One of the more popular VCS tools was a system called **RCS**, which is still distributed with many computers today. Even the popular Mac OS X operating system includes the rcs command when you install the Developer Tools. RCS works by keeping patch sets (that is, the differences between files) in a special format on disk; it can then re-create what any file looked like at any point in time by adding up all the patches."
